Dear Adam and Steve,

I’m reaching out to express my interest in a position with Tailwind Labs. Since it’s inception,
I’ve closely followed both of you closely from Test-Driven Laravel, Refactoring UI, Heroicons and Tailwind and have always been impressed by your work. I’ve dreamt of working with you both and the rest of the team at Tailwind Labs. From what I’ve seen it’s how I explain to people how work and projects should be done.

My commitment to open-source projects has been a driving force in my career over the past
six years, during which I’ve led diverse teams covering support, DevOps, and development.
My recent Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM) designation achievement underscores my
dedication to personal and professional growth.

Currently, I’m contracting with Investec Private Bank, the leading private bank in South Africa to optimize their developer experience
and their open APIs. Additionally, I led a transformative project at domains.co.za, where I
developed APIs to automate all products and services, resulting in exponential growth.
My solid engineering background, leadership skills and passion for learning make me an
ideal fit for the Tailwind Labs team. I excel in unfamiliar territory and thrive on precision and
attention to detail.

With extensive experience in Node.js, TypeScript, and experience
in Rust, I am well-equipped to contribute to your mentioned projects. Despite being stronger in
Vue than React, I am committed to improving and expanding my skill set.

I have accumulated over seven years of experience with US-based companies in Eastern Time and am
comfortable with independent contracting arrangements.

I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with a small, dynamic team at Tailwind
Labs and contribute to something truly remarkable. My unique experiences and skills will
complement the team well, and I look forward to possibly working together.
Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Devin Pearson
