Dear Adam and Steve,

I’m reaching out to express my interest in a position with Tailwind Labs. Since its inception,
I’ve closely followed Tailwind and have been impressed by its utility-first methodology,
particularly in simplifying traditional CSS complexities.

My commitment to open-source projects has been a driving force in my career over the past
six years, during which I’ve led diverse teams covering support, DevOps, and development.
My recent Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM) designation achievement underscores my
dedication to personal and professional growth.

Currently, I’m contracting with Investec Private Bank to optimize their developer experience
and open APIs. Additionally, I led a transformative project at domains.co.za, where I
developed APIs to automate services, resulting in exponential growth and efficiency gains.
My solid engineering background, leadership skills and passion for learning make me an
ideal fit for the Tailwind Labs team. I excel in unfamiliar territory and thrive on precision and
attention to detail.

With extensive experience in Node.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind and leadership experience
in Rust, I am well-equipped to contribute to innovative projects. Despite being stronger in
Vue than React, I am committed to improving and expanding my skill set.

I have accumulated over seven years of experience with US-based companies and am
comfortable with independent contracting arrangements.

I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with a small, dynamic team at Tailwind
Labs and contribute to something truly remarkable. My unique experiences and skills will
complement the team well, and I look forward to possibly working together.
Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Devin Pearson
